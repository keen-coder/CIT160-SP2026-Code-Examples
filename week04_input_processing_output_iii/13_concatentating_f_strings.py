# Two or more f-strings can be concatenated together just like normal strings.
# The result will also be an f-string.
#
# NOTE: If you leave out the f in front of any string in the concatenation,
# these will be treated as normal strings.

# Correctly concatenating with f-strings
name = 'Charles Summerton'
department = 'Sales'
position = 'Manager'
print(f'Employee Name: {name}, ' +
      f'Department: {department}, ' +
      f'Position: {position}')

# Forgetting the f with some strings
print(f'Employee Name: {name}, ' +
       'Department: {department}, ' +
       'Position: {position}')

# Implicit concatenation also works
print(f'Name: {name}, '
      f'Department: {department}, '
      f'Position: {position}')
