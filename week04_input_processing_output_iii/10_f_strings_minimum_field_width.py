# Format specifiers can also take an integer value to designate a minimum field
# width. This is the minimum number of spaces to be used to display the value.
#
# If the value is larger than the width, the column will be expanded to exactly
# accomodate the value.
#  
# If the value is smaller than the width, extra space will be padded to the left 
# of the value.
#
# If you put a 0 in front of the width value, the extra spaces will be replaced
# with leading zeros.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Formatting the value with a field width of 10
number = 99
print(f'The number is {number:10d}')

# Using leading zeros and field width
number = 99
print(f'The number is {number:010d}')

# If the value is larger than the width, the column will expand to accomodate
# exactly the right about of space with no extra padding
number = 9999
print(f'The number is {number:2d}')

# Formatting a float to 2 decimal places, group using commas, with a field width
# of 12

number = 12345.6789

# NOTE: The comma for grouping goes after the width and BEFORE the precision
# designator.
print(f'The number is {number:12,.2f}')

# Same example as the previous, but without the commas grouping
number = 12345.6789
print(f'The number is {number:12.2f}')

# Field widths are mainly used to display output in a tabular (table / 
# column-like format)
