# Formatted string literals or f-strings provide many ways to format your output.
# Be sure to read the pdf under this week's readings for even more examples.
#
# f-strings always start with a lowercase f BEFORE the opening quote.

# The following are examples of simple f-strings, when used this way they
# don't actually do anything different from regular strings.

# Look more use of named constants!
# You can use emojiis in some text editors and command lines.
# You don't need f-strings for emojiis
LEVEL_UP_TEXT = f'🎉 LEVEL UP 🎉!'
print(LEVEL_UP_TEXT)

GAME_OVER_TEXT = f'Game Over. Try again!'
print(GAME_OVER_TEXT)

WIN_MESSAGE = f'🏆 You win! 🏆'
print(WIN_MESSAGE)
