# This program demonstrates how a floating-point
# number is displayed with no formatting.
amount_due = 5000.0
monthly_payment = amount_due / 12.0
print(f'The monthly payment is {monthly_payment}.')

# This program demonstrates how a floating-point
# number can be rounded.
amount_due = 5000.0
monthly_payment = amount_due / 12.0

# .2 is the precision designator
# f is the type designator (in this case f means float)
print(f'The monthly payment is {monthly_payment:.2f}.')

# Rounding PI to 3 decimal places
pi = 3.1415926535
print(f'{pi:.3f}')

# Rounding to 1 decimal place
a = 2 
b = 3 
print(f'{(a / b):.1f}')
