# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Named Constants are names that represent special values in your program. These
# values should generally not change. They can be actual mathematical constants
# like PI, or Euler's number e and so on. 
#
# Most programming languages will enforce that a constant's value cannot change.
# Python does not do this but all programmers conventionally agree when something
# is a constant, they will not change the value.
#
# Constants should be named using ALL CAPS with words separated by underscores.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Without using constants, code is harder to read.
